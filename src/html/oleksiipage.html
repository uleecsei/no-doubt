                <p class="biography__text text">
                    Born in Los Angeles, California, the Buchko family lived in
                    Irvine, California. Lesha was the only adopted child in his
                    family and has two siblings.Buchko's father, who played the
                    piano, gave his son a guitar at age twelve. Buchko practiced
                    by strumming folk songs by the likes of James Taylor. Buchko
                    was influenced by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden,
                    Judas Priest and KISS. He joined his older sister's heavy
                    metal band Rising, but left in 1988 for third wave ska band
                    No Doubt. He has one sister named Gina and a brother named
                    John.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Buchko studied music theory for five semesters at Orange
                    Coast College. When the band moved into a house on Beacon
                    Avenue in Anaheim, he wrote a poem about being addicted to
                    television. He took the poem to Eric Stefani, who put the
                    poem to music and came up with the song "Trapped in a Box".
                    The song was recorded for the band's self-titled debut album
                    and was the album's only single.

                    self-released The Beacon Street Collection in March 1995.
                    The same month, Buchko left his job as a file clerk at a
                    mortgage company. He had "a good feeling" about having
                    finished recording Tragic Kingdom and planned to fall back
                    on promoting rock concerts if the album was not successful.
                    Tragic Kingdom became a commercial success, certified
                    diamond in the United States and selling sixteen million
                    copies worldwide. When Eric left the band, Lesha, along with
                    bandmates Gwen Stefani and Tony Kanal, took leadership in
                    writing and composing responsibilities.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    After the Tragic Kingdom tour, Lesha returned to his home in
                    Long Beach, California and started surfing in 1997. Buchko
                    is a member of The Surfrider Foundation, an environmental
                    organization to preserve coastal life. Since Eric Stefani
                    left, Lesha Buchko, Tony Kanal and Gwen Stefani became No
                    Doubt's primary songwriters.

                    During No Doubt's hiatus, Buchko produced Matt Costa's 2005
                    debut album, titled Songs We Sing, after hearing a demo tape
                    by Costa.

                <p class="biography__text text">
                    With Stefani promoting her second solo album, No Doubt began
                    initial work on a new album without her and planned to
                    complete it after Stefani's tour was finished. In March
                    2008, the band started making posts concerning the
                    progression of the album on their official fan forum.
                    Stefani made a post on March 28, 2008 stating that
                    songwriting had commenced but was slow on her end because
                    she was, at the time, pregnant with her second child.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Manager Jim Guerinot said the yet-untitled album is being
                    produced by Mark "Spike" Stent, who helped produce and mix
                    Rock Steady. Between Stefani's pregnancy and recording, No
                    Doubt did not tour in 2008, but Guerinot promised, they plan
                    to hit the road hard in 2009 for their first full-fledged
                    band tour in nearly five years.
